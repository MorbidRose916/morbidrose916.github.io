A storm is bearing down on Chaco Navajo Reservation. The Arroyo is in shambles. Its people gone missing. Grant, Kai and the few others that remain may not have the strength to withstand what’s coming.

No one shows more distress in the face of this darkness than the baby still growing inside of Caroline. She and Owen soon find themselves in a fight to save the life of their unborn child before the storm—and all it brings—snuffs out its spark.

Meanwhile, the Walker searches across worlds to find the missing people of the Arroyo before the coming flood erases their trail entirely. Without them the Rez is already falling apart piece by piece.

Their only hope lies in finding and defeating the powerful medicine man Jacob Dark Sky, along with the mysterious one he a creature known only as Black Bear. But Dark Sky is strong, and Black Bear is cunning.

If the Walker and his circle of friends ever hope to win, they must hold fast to their homeland and to one another. But even then, the great balance cannot be restored without great sacrifice.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
