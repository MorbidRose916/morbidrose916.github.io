On the Rez, everything is connected. Black Bear is banished, but the scars he left in his wake wonâ€™t heal. To set things right and return what was lost, Owen and Ben must chance a journey along a dangerous road that bridges the land of the living and the dead.

As long as Black Bear cheats death, the barrier between worlds grows weaker. He cannot return to the Rez, but his reach is long and he has dark creatures under his control. Two killers on a collision course with the Rez are living proof. Rumor has it they carry black totems carved into the shape of a bear, and their gaze means death.

The Arroyo elders tell stories of how the ancients once rid the world of monsters. Now, Black Bear wants to bring them back and destroy the great balance forever. In order to set things right, everyone who calls the Arroyo home must find a way to confront him once and for all, before his darkness blankets all of them.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND!
