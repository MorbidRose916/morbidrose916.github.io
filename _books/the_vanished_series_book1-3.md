I am not really good giving reviews without giving away surprises intended on the emotionally driven storyline. I will summarize each book going forward in order to potentially intrigue readers to look into the books themselves!

Follow the Crow (Book 1)

Ben Dejooli is a Navajo cop who can't escape his past. Six years ago his little sister Ana vanished without a trace. His best friend saw what happened but he refuses to speak of what he knows, and so was banished from the Navajo tribe. That was the day the crows started following Ben. What the crows know will change his life, and the lives of those he loves, forever.

Beyond the Veil (Book 2)

The bell that holds power over life and death has been lost. The race to find it has begun, and our world hangs in the balance.

Caroline and Owen search for the bell across the land of the living. Ben Dejooli, now known as the Walker, searches the land of the dead. Their mission is to protect the bell and keep it secret. Others seek the bell as well, but they have different plans... plans that could disrupt the careful balance between life and death that has stood since the beginning of time.

When a young boy finds the bell out in the plains of Texas, he quickly becomes the target of a showdown between the lands of the living and the dead, and those that want to rule over both.

The Coyote Way (Book 3)

The Walker chases a rogue spirit, something dark and chaotic that broke through into the land of the living and took on the form of a coyote.

Caroline and Owen have been on the move for years trying to find a place to call home. Caroline remains torn--her heart split in two. Half of her loves Owen, the other half still loves Ben. Grant travels with them, but he struggles with the weight of his position as Keeper and wants to carve his own path. Everywhere they go they find a strange malice and unease waiting for them. The coyote's handiwork.

They don't know it yet, but all of them are travelling in the same direction. Back to Chaco Navajo Reservation . . . which is exactly what the coyote wants.---Summary.
