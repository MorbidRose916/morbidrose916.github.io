I thrive in environments that demand clear thinking, adaptability, and continuous learning — all of which translate naturally into writing clean, efficient code.</p> <p>This GitHub is where I’m documenting my journey into development, building real projects, and laying the foundation for a career in Tech. When I’m not coding, you will find me reading a book or soaking up time with my family and staying grounded in the values that got me this far.</p> <p>“<strong><em>New to Code, Not New to Pressure.</em></strong>”</p> </body></html>
