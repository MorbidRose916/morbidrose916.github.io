From guiding aircraft through complex airspace to navigating the logic of code â€” I spent 11 years as a U.S. Army Air Traffic Controller, and now I want to channel that same precision, focus, and calm-under-pressure mindset into software development.

I'm new to the tech world, but Iâ€™m no stranger to high-stakes problem-solving. I thrive in environments that demand clear thinking, adaptability, and continuous learning â€” all of which translate naturally into writing clean, efficient code.

This GitHub is where Iâ€™m documenting my journey into development, my schooling through CodeCademy, building real projects, and laying the foundation for a career in Tech. When Iâ€™m not coding, you will find me reading a book or soaking up time with my family and staying grounded in the values that got me this far.
