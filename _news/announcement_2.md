Sought out "How to make a personal page" once I got half-way through my GitHub lesson. Started a new adventure and let the flow take me where it goes!

There is tons of knowledge to help you with creating your own GitHub page across the internet. Google and YouTube were my best friends through it all. In CodeCademy, I learned the difference between HTML and Markdown (Comes in handy if using a Jekyll Theme). Google points you in the right direction, while YouTube shows countless visuals and walk-throughs to help learn more or assist when you're questioning about getting stuck over something. I personally found  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFOdDg-Elbg">MathQuantum's</a> tutorial to be the most helpful to get the page started and live. Even assists in showing you where a few files within the repository are, that you can edit in order to personalize a bit more! The tutorial held my hand when I needed it and helped figure a few things out while Google was there to help when I struggled and questioned what I needed to find in order to change other things. As long as you keep pushing, you'll get there.

The theme I ended up choosing was the <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">Al-folio</a> theme for its professional appearance and customization with ease.
See below for stock sub-pages available through the Al-folio theme repository:


#### Sub-Pages

<ul>
    <li>about</li>
    <li>teaching</li>
    <li>blogs</li>
    <li>books</li>
    <li>projects</li>
    <li>publications</li>
    <li>repositories</li>
    <li>news</li>
    <li>posts</li>
</ul>

All-in-all, the possibilities feel endless. Knowing Markdown shortcuts will benefit you when you simply want to hide specific things that you may not be ready to share with the world. HTML comes in handy when you want to pull certain things from the NavBar. Even then, the listed sub-pages can be edited and turned into something else. 
Take the "teaching" page for example. I am beginning my journey, so Lord knows I am not teaching anything. I took the initiative to turn it into a "Learning" page in order to track my progression through my courses on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">CodeCademy</a>. It allows me, as well as potential employers, to view my progression and capabilities.

Have fun with it, and continue to learn. I just started a few months ago and here I am already personalizing my own page. You can do it too!

*NOTE*: <a href="https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/downloads/">Ruby</a>, <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/">Jekyll</a>, <a href="https://desktop.github.com/download/">GitHub Desktop</a>, and an editing software (I personally use <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">Visual Code Studio</a>), will be needed to finish getting your page going in a timely manner using a Jekyll Theme. Ruby and Jekyll are the meat and bones of the theme in itself. Allowing the page to render appropriately. While the GitHub desktop and editing software allows you to edit code, make your commits easily, and push it all back to your github.io within minutes compared to manually doing it all through your browser.
