Sought out "How to make a personal page" once I got half-way through my GitHub lesson. Started a new adventure and letting the flow take me where it goes!

There are tons of knowledge to help you with creating your own GitHub page across the internet. Google and YouTube are my best friends as of late. Through CodeCademy I learned the difference between HTML and Markdown (Comes in handy if using a Jekyll Theme), Google getting you in the right direction, and YouTube showing countless visuals and walk-throughs to help learn more or assist when you're questioning about getting stuck over something. I personally found  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wFOdDg-Elbg">MathQuantum's</a> tutorial to be the most helpful to get the page started. The tutorial held my hand when I needed it and helped me figure a few things out while Google was there to help when I struggled. As long as you keep pushing, the possibilities are endless!

The theme I ended up choosing was the <a href="https://github.com/alshedivat/al-folio">Al-folio</a> theme for its professional appearance and what feels like endless customization with ease.
See below for aavailable sun-pages:


#### Sub-Pages

<ul>
    <li>about</li>
    <li>teaching</li>
    <li>blogs</li>
    <li>books</li>
    <li>projects</li>
    <li>publications</li>
    <li>repositories</li>
    <li>news</li>
    <li>posts</li>
</ul>

All-in-all the possibilities feel endless. Knowing Markdown shortcuts will benefit you when you simply want to hide specific things that you may not be ready to share with the world. HTML comes in handy when you want to pull certain things from the NavBar. Even then, the listed sub-pages can be edited and turned into something else. 
Take the "teaching" page for example. I am beginning my journey, so Lord knows I am not teaching anything. I took the initiative to turn it into a "Learning" page in order to track my progression through my courses on <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">CodeCademy</a>. It allows me, as well as potential employers, to view my progression and capabilities.

Have fun with it, and continue to learn. I just started a few months ago and here I am already personalizing my own page. You can do it too!
